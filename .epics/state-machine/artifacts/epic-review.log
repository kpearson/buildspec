Excellent! All changes have been successfully applied. Let me create a summary of the work completed:

## Summary

I have successfully applied all Priority 1 and Priority 2 review feedback to the state-machine epic. Here's what was accomplished:

### Priority 1 Fixes (Must Fix - All Completed ✅)

1. **Epic baseline commit definition** - Added clear documentation defining this critical term used throughout the epic
2. **_calculate_dependency_depth() method** - Added missing function signature to resolve ambiguity in ticket ordering logic
3. **State file versioning strategy** - Implemented concrete versioning approach with schema_version: 1 field
4. **Integration test dependencies** - Fixed dependency graph to enable parallel execution and include missing create-git-operations dependency
5. **Validation gate failure test** - Added critical test case for ValidationGate rejection scenarios

### Priority 2 Fixes (Should Fix - All Completed ✅)

6. **Git error handling pattern** - Documented consistent error handling approach across all git operations
7. **Builder timeout handling** - Clarified timeout behavior as ticket failure with standard cascading
8. **Epic branch creation test** - Added verification for state machine initialization logic
9. **find_most_recent_commit() test documentation** - Made diamond dependency test coverage explicit

### Files Modified

- `/Users/kit/Code/buildspec/.epics/state-machine/state-machine.epic.yaml` - Applied all 9 fixes using surgical edits
- `/Users/kit/Code/buildspec/.epics/state-machine/artifacts/epic-review-updates.md` - Created comprehensive documentation

### Impact

The epic is now **fully deployable** with:
- ✅ All critical ambiguities resolved
- ✅ Complete integration test coverage specified
- ✅ Correct dependency graph enabling parallelization
- ✅ Clear implementation guidance for all tickets

The state-machine epic can now proceed to execution with confidence.

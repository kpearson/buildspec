# Epic Review Updates

## Changes Applied

### Priority 1 Fixes

**1. Added epic baseline commit definition** (epic YAML line 195)

- Added pattern documentation: "Epic baseline commit: The git commit SHA from
  which the epic branch was created (typically main branch HEAD at epic
  initialization). First ticket branches from this commit; subsequent tickets
  stack on previous ticket's final_commit."
- Resolves: Review issue about undefined term used throughout epic and tickets
- Impact: Clarifies critical concept for CreateBranchGate implementation

**2. Added \_calculate_dependency_depth() method to function profiles** (epic
YAML lines 57-60)

- Added method signature: `_calculate_dependency_depth(ticket: Ticket) -> int`
- Intent: "Calculates dependency depth for ticket ordering (0 for no deps, 1 +
  max(dep_depth) for deps)"
- Resolves: Review issue about undefined method referenced in spec
  implementation
- Impact: Eliminates ambiguity in core-state-machine ticket ordering logic

**3. Clarified state file versioning strategy** (epic YAML lines 55, 377, 521)

- Updated \_save_state() intent to include "with schema_version field"
- Added schema_version: 1 to core-state-machine acceptance criteria
- Updated \_validate_loaded_state() to check "schema_version field equals 1
  (current version)"
- Resolves: Review issue about mentioned but unimplemented versioning
- Impact: Provides concrete implementation path for version checking

**4. Fixed integration test dependencies** (epic YAML lines 585, 602)

- add-failure-scenario-integration-tests: Changed from depending on
  add-happy-path-integration-test to depending on ["core-state-machine",
  "create-git-operations", "implement-failure-handling",
  "implement-rollback-logic", "implement-finalization-logic"]
- add-resume-integration-test: Changed from depending on
  add-happy-path-integration-test to depending on ["core-state-machine",
  "create-git-operations", "implement-resume-from-state"]
- Resolves: Review issue about incomplete dependency graph and missing
  create-git-operations
- Impact: Enables parallel execution of integration tests, removes unnecessary
  sequential constraint

**5. Added validation gate failure integration test** (epic YAML lines 576,
578, 580)

- Added test_validation_gate_failure() scenario to
  add-failure-scenario-integration-tests ticket
- Test description: "Mock builder returns success with test_status='failing',
  verify ticket transitions to FAILED, verify dependent tickets blocked, verify
  epic continues with independent tickets"
- Updated acceptance criteria to include validation gate failure test
  verification
- Resolves: Review issue about critical quality gate not being tested end-to-end
- Impact: Ensures ValidationGate rejection logic is integration tested

### Priority 2 Fixes

**6. Added git error handling pattern documentation** (epic YAML line 196)

- Added pattern: "Git error handling: All git operations raise GitError on
  failure with captured stderr; gates and state machine catch GitError and
  convert to GateResult/ticket failure"
- Resolves: Review issue about inconsistent error handling documentation
- Impact: Clarifies error handling contract for all git operations

**7. Clarified builder timeout handling** (epic YAML line 349)

- Updated create-claude-builder acceptance criteria: "Timeout enforced at 3600
  seconds (returns BuilderResult with error, treated as ticket FAILED with
  standard failure cascade to dependents)"
- Added requirement: "Prompt includes all necessary context (ticket, branch,
  epic, output requirements) and example JSON output format matching
  BuilderResult fields"
- Resolves: Review issues about ambiguous timeout semantics and output format
  specification
- Impact: Makes builder timeout behavior explicit as ticket failure with
  cascading

**8. Added epic branch creation verification to happy path test** (epic YAML
line 557)

- Updated test_happy_path_3_sequential_tickets description to include: "verify
  epic branch created if not exists (or uses existing epic branch)"
- Resolves: Review issue about untested epic branch initialization logic
- Impact: Ensures state machine epic branch creation logic is tested

**9. Added find_most_recent_commit() test documentation** (epic YAML line 576)

- Updated test_diamond_dependency_partial_execution description: "This test
  validates find_most_recent_commit() selects correct base when ticket D depends
  on both B and C."
- Updated acceptance criteria to mention "find_most_recent_commit() logic"
- Resolves: Review issue about implicit test coverage of multiple dependency
  logic
- Impact: Makes test coverage of critical diamond dependency logic explicit

## Changes Not Applied

No recommended changes were rejected. All Priority 1 and Priority 2 fixes from
the review report were successfully applied to the epic YAML file. The following
were noted but not implemented:

**Priority 3 items (Nice to Have):**

- Epic-level timeout as future enhancement: Not implemented (marked as future
  work)
- Branch naming flexibility: Not implemented (hardcoded "ticket/" prefix is
  sufficient for v1)

These Priority 3 items were marked as future enhancements in the review and do
not block epic execution.

## Summary

Applied all 5 Priority 1 fixes and 4 Priority 2 improvements to the
state-machine epic YAML file. Changes focused on clarifying ambiguous
specifications (epic baseline commit, state file versioning, builder timeout
semantics), fixing dependency graph issues (integration test dependencies),
adding missing function definitions (\_calculate_dependency_depth), and
enhancing test coverage (validation gate failure test, epic branch creation
test). The epic is now fully deployable with all critical ambiguities resolved
and complete integration test coverage specified.

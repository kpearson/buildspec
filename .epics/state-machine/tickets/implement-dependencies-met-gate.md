# implement-dependencies-met-gate

## Description
Implement DependenciesMetGate to verify all ticket dependencies are COMPLETED

## Epic Context
This gate enforces the dependency ordering that is fundamental to the epic execution strategy. It ensures that a ticket cannot start until all its dependencies have successfully completed.

**Git Strategy Context**:
- Each ticket branches from previous ticket's final commit (true stacking)
- Dependencies must be COMPLETED before a ticket can use their final_commit as a base

**Key Objectives**:
- Deterministic State Transitions: Python code enforces state machine rules, LLM cannot bypass gates
- Validation Gates: Automated checks before allowing state transitions

**Key Constraints**:
- Validation gates automatically verify LLM work before accepting state transitions
- Synchronous execution enforced (concurrency = 1)

## Acceptance Criteria
- DependenciesMetGate checks all dependencies are in COMPLETED state
- Returns GateResult with passed=True if all dependencies met
- Returns GateResult with passed=False and reason if any dependency not complete
- Handles tickets with no dependencies (always pass)
- Handles tickets with multiple dependencies

## Files to Modify
- /Users/kit/Code/buildspec/epic/gates.py

## Additional Notes
This gate is run when transitioning a ticket from PENDING to READY. It checks the current state of all dependencies and only allows the transition if all are COMPLETED.

For tickets with no dependencies, the gate should always pass.

The gate should return a clear reason when dependencies are not met, listing which dependencies are incomplete and their current states. This helps with debugging and understanding execution flow.

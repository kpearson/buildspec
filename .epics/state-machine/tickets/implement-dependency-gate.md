# DependenciesMetGate for dependency validation

**Ticket ID:** implement-dependency-gate

**Critical:** true

**Dependencies:** create-gate-interface, create-state-models

**Coordination Role:** Enforces dependency ordering for state machine ticket execution

## Description

As a state machine developer, I want a DependenciesMetGate that validates ticket dependencies are completed so that tickets execute in correct dependency order and never start prematurely.

This ticket creates the DependenciesMetGate class in gates.py implementing the TransitionGate protocol (ticket: create-gate-interface). The state machine (ticket: core-state-machine) runs this gate when checking if PENDING tickets can transition to READY (in _get_ready_tickets method). The gate iterates through ticket.depends_on list and verifies each dependency ticket has state=COMPLETED. Key function to implement:
- check(ticket: Ticket, context: EpicContext) -> GateResult: For each dep_id in ticket.depends_on, get dep_ticket from context.tickets, check if dep_ticket.state == TicketState.COMPLETED, return GateResult(passed=False, reason="Dependency {dep_id} not complete") if any incomplete, return GateResult(passed=True) if all complete

## Acceptance Criteria

- Gate checks all dependencies in ticket.depends_on list
- Returns passed=True only if ALL dependencies have state=COMPLETED
- Returns passed=False with clear reason identifying first unmet dependency
- Handles empty depends_on list correctly (returns passed=True)
- Does not allow dependencies in FAILED or BLOCKED state to pass

## Testing

Unit tests with mock EpicContext containing various dependency states: all completed (should pass), one pending (should fail), one failed (should fail), one blocked (should fail), empty list (should pass). Coverage: 100%.

## Non-Goals

No dependency graph analysis, no circular dependency detection (assumed valid from epic YAML), no transitive dependency checking - only direct dependencies.

# implement-llm-start-gate

## Description
Implement LLMStartGate to enforce synchronous execution and verify branch exists

## Epic Context
This gate enforces the synchronous execution constraint - only one ticket can be actively worked on at a time. This prevents race conditions and ensures deterministic execution order.

**Key Objectives**:
- Deterministic State Transitions: Python code enforces state machine rules, LLM cannot bypass gates
- Validation Gates: Automated checks before allowing state transitions

**Key Constraints**:
- Synchronous execution enforced (concurrency = 1)
- LLM agents interact with state machine via CLI commands only

## Acceptance Criteria
- LLMStartGate enforces concurrency = 1 (only one ticket in IN_PROGRESS or AWAITING_VALIDATION)
- Returns GateResult with passed=False if another ticket is active
- Verifies branch exists on remote before allowing start
- Returns GateResult with passed=True if concurrency limit not exceeded and branch exists

## Dependencies
- create-gate-interface-and-protocol
- implement-git-operations-wrapper

## Files to Modify
- /Users/kit/Code/buildspec/epic/gates.py

## Additional Notes
This gate is run when transitioning a ticket from BRANCH_CREATED to IN_PROGRESS. It enforces two critical constraints:

1. **Concurrency = 1**: Checks that no other ticket is currently IN_PROGRESS or AWAITING_VALIDATION. This ensures tickets execute one at a time, maintaining deterministic execution order.

2. **Branch Exists**: Verifies the ticket's branch exists on the remote. This validates that the CreateBranchGate succeeded and the LLM has a branch to work with.

The gate should return a clear reason when failing, indicating either which ticket is currently active (if concurrency violated) or that the branch doesn't exist.

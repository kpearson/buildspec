# add-state-machine-unit-tests

## Description
Add comprehensive unit tests for state machine, gates, and git operations

## Epic Context
Unit tests ensure the state machine enforces all invariants correctly. These tests validate that the deterministic, code-enforced rules work as designed.

**Key Objectives**:
- Deterministic State Transitions: Tests verify state machine rules are enforced
- Validation Gates: Tests verify gates correctly validate conditions
- Git Strategy Enforcement: Tests verify git operations work correctly

**Key Constraints**:
- Integration tests verify state machine enforces all invariants
- Git operations are deterministic and tested

## Acceptance Criteria
- Test all state transitions (valid and invalid)
- Test all gates with passing and failing scenarios
- Test git operations wrapper with mocked git commands
- Test state file persistence (save and load)
- Test dependency checking logic
- Test base commit calculation for stacked branches
- Test concurrency enforcement
- Test validation gate checks
- Test ticket failure and blocking logic
- All tests use pytest with fixtures
- Tests are in tests/epic/test_state_machine.py, test_gates.py, test_git_operations.py

## Dependencies
- implement-finalize-epic-api
- create-epic-cli-commands

## Files to Modify
- /Users/kit/Code/buildspec/tests/epic/test_state_machine.py
- /Users/kit/Code/buildspec/tests/epic/test_gates.py
- /Users/kit/Code/buildspec/tests/epic/test_git_operations.py

## Additional Notes
Test coverage should include:

**test_state_machine.py**:
- Test state machine initialization (new vs resume)
- Test state file save/load (including atomic writes)
- Test valid transitions (PENDING→READY, READY→BRANCH_CREATED, etc.)
- Test invalid transitions (PENDING→COMPLETED, etc.)
- Test _is_valid_transition logic
- Test _run_gate execution and logging
- Test _update_epic_state based on ticket states
- Test concurrency enforcement
- Test failure cascading to dependent tickets

**test_gates.py**:
- Test DependenciesMetGate (all deps met, some missing, no deps)
- Test CreateBranchGate (no deps, single dep, multiple deps, base commit calculation)
- Test LLMStartGate (concurrency enforcement, branch existence check)
- Test ValidationGate (commit existence, test status, acceptance criteria)
- Mock git operations for all gate tests

**test_git_operations.py**:
- Test create_branch with mocked git commands
- Test push_branch, delete_branch
- Test get_commits_between
- Test commit_exists, commit_on_branch
- Test find_most_recent_commit
- Test merge_branch with squash strategy
- Test error handling (GitError exceptions)

Use pytest fixtures for common setup (mock state machine, mock git, test tickets).

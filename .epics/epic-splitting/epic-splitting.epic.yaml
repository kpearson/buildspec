      1. Epic with exactly 12 tickets - should NOT split
      2. Epic with 13 independent tickets - should split into 2 independent epics
      3. Epic with 25 independent tickets - should split into 2-3 independent epics
      4. Epic with 20 tickets in dependency chain - should NOT split (warn user)
      5. Epic with 40 tickets - should split into 3+ independent epics
      6. Verify each split epic is fully independent (no cross-epic dependencies)
      7. Verify dependencies preserved within each epic
      8. Verify ticket quality maintained after split
      9. Verify original epic is archived correctly
      10. Verify --no-split flag bypasses workflow

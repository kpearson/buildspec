# Epic File Review - Simple Test Epic

## Review Summary

This is a test review artifact for validating epic-file-review feedback application.
The review identifies specific improvements that should be applied to the epic YAML file.

## Critical Issues

- [ ] **Missing non-goals section**: The epic should explicitly state what is out of scope
  - Add a non-goals section to clarify boundaries
  - Example: "Testing with production data", "Cross-platform compatibility testing"

## High Priority

- [ ] **Improve coordination requirements**: Current requirements are too generic
  - Add specific technical constraints
  - Mention data flow between tickets
  - Example: "TEST-001 must complete before TEST-002 can access shared state"

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Enhance epic description**: Add more context about testing purpose
  - Clarify that this is a fixture for integration tests
  - Mention expected outcomes from running tests

- [ ] **Add testing strategy section**: Epic should document how it will be tested
  - Include manual testing steps
  - Document expected modifications from review feedback

## Low Priority

- [ ] **Improve ticket descriptions**: Some tickets lack sufficient detail
  - TEST-001: Add more context about what it's testing
  - TEST-002: Clarify dependency on TEST-001
  - TEST-003: Explain end-to-end validation approach

## Suggestions

- Consider adding a "Test Execution" section to the epic
- Document expected review feedback changes for validation
- Add version or iteration number for tracking test fixture updates

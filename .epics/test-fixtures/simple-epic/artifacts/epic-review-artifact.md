# Epic Review - Simple Test Epic with Tickets

## Review Summary

This is a test review artifact for validating epic-review feedback application.
Unlike epic-file-review, this review covers both the epic YAML and all ticket markdown files,
testing the multi-file update workflow.

## Epic-Level Issues

### Critical

- [ ] **Add testing strategy to epic**: Epic needs explicit testing approach
  - Document unit test requirements
  - Document integration test approach
  - Specify test coverage expectations

### High Priority

- [ ] **Enhance coordination requirements**: Add more specific cross-ticket dependencies
  - Document state shared between TEST-001 and TEST-002
  - Clarify handoff points between tickets
  - Add timing constraints if any

## Ticket-Specific Issues

### TEST-001: First test ticket

#### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Add implementation details**: Ticket needs technical specifics
  - What files will be modified?
  - What functions will be created?
  - Add example code snippets

- [ ] **Clarify acceptance criteria**: Current criteria are too vague
  - Make criteria measurable and testable
  - Add specific pass/fail conditions

### TEST-002: Second test ticket

#### High Priority

- [ ] **Document dependency on TEST-001**: Clarify what is needed from TEST-001
  - What outputs from TEST-001 are inputs to TEST-002?
  - What happens if TEST-001 is incomplete?

#### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Add testing section**: Ticket needs test strategy
  - Unit tests required
  - Integration tests needed
  - Manual verification steps

### TEST-003: Third test ticket

#### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Add definition of done**: Final ticket needs clear completion criteria
  - All previous tickets integrated
  - End-to-end validation complete
  - Documentation updated

- [ ] **Document validation approach**: Explain how to verify success
  - What metrics indicate success?
  - What are the acceptance thresholds?

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### All Tickets

- [ ] **Add error handling requirements**: All tickets should specify error scenarios
- [ ] **Include logging requirements**: Standardize logging approach across tickets
- [ ] **Add performance expectations**: Define acceptable performance bounds

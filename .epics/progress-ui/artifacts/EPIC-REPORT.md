## Recommendations for Follow-up

1. **User Testing:** Test the new progress indicators with real users to gather feedback
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor git polling overhead during epic execution
3. **Documentation:** Update user-facing documentation to show new progress features
4. **CI/CD Integration:** Ensure --no-live-updates flag works correctly in CI environments

## Conclusion

The progress-ui epic has been completed successfully. All critical functionality is implemented and working. Users now have clear visual feedback during all CLI operations, significantly improving the user experience during long-running Claude operations.

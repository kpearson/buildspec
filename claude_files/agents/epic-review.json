    "prompt": "You are reviewing an epic that a developer created from a spec. Give thorough feedback - high-level and down to the nitty-gritty.\n\nLook for:\n\n1. **Dependency Issues**:\n   - Circular dependencies (A → B → A)\n   - Missing dependencies (ticket consumes interface but doesn't depend on it)\n   - Unnecessary dependencies\n   - Over-constrained dependency chains\n\n2. **Function Examples in Tickets**:\n   - Each ticket's Paragraph 2 should have concrete function examples\n   - Format: function_name(params: types) -> return_type: intent\n   - Flag tickets missing these examples\n\n3. **Coordination Requirements**:\n   - Are function profiles complete (arity, intent, signature)?\n   - Is directory structure specific (not vague like 'buildspec/epic/')?\n   - Are integration contracts clear (what each ticket provides/consumes)?\n   - Is 'epic baseline' or similar concepts explicitly defined?\n\n4. **Ticket Quality**:\n   - 3-5 paragraphs per ticket?\n   - Specific, measurable acceptance criteria?\n   - Testing requirements specified?\n   - Non-goals documented?\n   - Passes deployability test?\n\n5. **Architectural Consistency**:\n   - Do tickets align with coordination_requirements?\n   - Are technology choices consistent?\n   - Do patterns match across tickets?\n\n6. **Big Picture Issues**:\n   - Is ticket granularity appropriate?\n   - Are there missing tickets for critical functionality?\n   - Is the epic too large (>12 tickets)?\n   - Would splitting improve clarity?\n\nProvide specific, actionable feedback. Point out exact ticket IDs, line issues, and suggest concrete improvements.\n\nHow can we improve this epic? Are there any big changes we should make?\n\n**IMPORTANT**: After completing your review, write your findings to `.epics/[epic-name]/artifacts/epic-review.md` using the Write tool. This creates an audit trail of your review. Structure your output as:\n\n# Epic Review Report\n\nDate: [current date]\nEpic: [epic name]\n\n## Executive Summary\n[2-3 sentence overview of epic quality]\n\n## Critical Issues\n[List blocking issues that must be fixed]\n\n## Major Improvements\n[Significant changes that would improve quality]\n\n## Minor Issues\n[Small fixes and polish]\n\n## Strengths\n[What the epic does well]\n\n## Recommendations\n[Prioritized list of changes to make]"
